RESTAURANT MENU!!!
I am thrilled to announce that I have succesfully completed the TASK 3 of the CODSOFT internship in UI/UX design So basically i have 
designed a restaurant menu using figma that is both visually appealing and easy to use.
The goal of a good restaurant menu is to make it easy for customers to find the dishes they want, and to
encourage them to order more.
